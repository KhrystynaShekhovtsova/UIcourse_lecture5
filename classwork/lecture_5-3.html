	    <p>This is specified by the z-index CSS property. It represents the third dimension of the box: its position along the "z axis". The boxes are divided into stacks (called stacking contexts). In each stack the back elements will be painted first and the forward elements on top, closer to the user. In case of overlap the foremost element will hide the former element. The stacks are ordered according to the z-index property. Boxes with "z-index" property form a local stack. The viewport has the outer stack.
